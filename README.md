This program is designed to take in code as input through one way:
./Project2 [filename]
The program will then tokenize the code in the file and output it to the screen
It will then put the tokens in order through the parser to see if it matches the grammar for our language
It will output success or an error message
No tree will display because I'm a dumbass

Note: I'm suffering because I did the first project wrong and my way of adjusting it to the first part of this
project took away the only option to make a tree.

Known Errors: Sometimes the line number will be incorrect for the EOF Token
